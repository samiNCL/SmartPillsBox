        Uncomoment in fetch() to call check()
         For simplicity,  I will unrealistically assume that the carer set a plan for the patient to have pills at any time. 
        This means any occurrence of opening the box will be considered as taking a pill. In a real situation, I would use this function
        to check the sensor data against the plan set for the patient. For example 2 Medicines , 3 times a day, at 10 am 4 pm 9 pm
        The trial code here will run on the terminal only. 
        Also, I would provide UI  for the carer to set these options. 

        However, I provide bellow code that generate fake data like what PIR sensor would send. 
        To  demonestrate the idea of the full functioning prototype. Note: results on terminal only

        Let's assume  here that patient must take pills twice , every day, at 11 am 18 pm
        we will generate 3 indecators
        crInpt is the carer input. Carer decide the time of taking pills.
