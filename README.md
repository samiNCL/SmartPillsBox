# SmartPillsBox

## Prototype demonstration 
   This code aim to run a smart box supplied with a Passive Infrared Sensor PIR sensor. The significant files :
`<server.mjs>`
`<./public/Index.html>`


### Please concider to install NodeJS Modules via NMP
##### It works on Raspberry PI (Linux)
##### Once You installed Node Modules in the project folder, Run: `<node server.mjs>` Check no errors on Terminal. Then visit  `<localhost:3000>`

##### If you do not have raspberry pi or PIR , Open the`<./public/Index.html>`  and read in-code comments to see how it can be demonstrated based on fake data   (Not from the sensor data ) on the Console.
 
 
 # What does this prototype do?
 It is a smart pillbox for people with chronic conditions who need regular help in tracking their intake. So when the box opened on the time range that they should take the medicine, this will be reported positively. Otherwise, there is a problem. There are in-code comments that describe the idea more technically.
