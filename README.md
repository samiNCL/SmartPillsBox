# SmartPillsBox
 
####Prototype demonstration This code aim to run a smart box supplied with a Passive Infrared Sensor PIR sensor. The significant files :

#####server.mjs
#####./public/Index.html****

Please concider to install NodeJS Modules via NMP
It works on Raspberry PI (Linux)
Once You installed Node Modules in the project folder, Run: node server.mjs Check no errors on Terminal. Then visit localhost:3000

If you do not have raspberry pi or PIR , Open the ./public/Index.html and read in-code comments to see how it can be demonstrated based on fake data (Not from the sensor data ) on the Console.

Thanks,\n Sami
