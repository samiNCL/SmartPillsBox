# SmartPillsBox
Prototype demonstration 
This code aim to run smart box supplied with Passive Infrared Sensor PIR sensor. The signifcant files : 
* server.mjs 
* ./public/Index.html

# Please concider to install NodeJS Modules via NMP 
# It works on Raspberri PI (Linux)

Once You installed Node Modules in the project folder , Run : node server.mjs
Check no errors on Terminal. Then visit localhost:3000

If you do not have raspberry pi or PIR , Open the ./public/Index.html and read in-code comments to see how it can be demonestrated based on fake data (Not from the sensor data ) on the Console. 

Thanks, 
Sami
