# SmartPillsBox

 <br />Prototype demonstration <br />
 **This code aim to run a smart box supplied with a Passive Infrared Sensor PIR sensor. The significant files :<br />
`<server.mjs>`
`<./public/Index.html>`


 <br />Please concider to install NodeJS Modules via NMP
 <br />*It works on Raspberry PI (Linux)
 <br />*Once You installed Node Modules in the project folder, Run: `<node server.mjs>` Check no errors on Terminal. Then visit  `<localhost:3000>`

 <br />If you do not have raspberry pi or PIR , Open the`<./public/Index.html>`  and read in-code comments to see how it can be demonstrated based on fake data  <br />(Not from the sensor data ) on the Console.
